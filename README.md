# Reinforcement-Learning-Project-2022
This assignment is for the course COMS4061A/COMS7071A (Reinforcement Learning) at The University of The Witwatersrand. The following members worked together on this assignment:
- Sheslin Naidoo
- Nico Jared Govindsamy
- Mohammed Gathoo

This repository contains the PyTorch implementations of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) agents for the MiniHack environment, as well as plots and videos for specific runs, and a detailed analysis report for the entire assignment. 

"MiniHack is a sandbox framework for easily designing rich and diverse environments for Reinforcement Learning (RL). Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack uses the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE) to communicate with the game and to provide a convenient interface for customly created RL training and test environments of varying complexity." - https://github.com/facebookresearch/minihack
